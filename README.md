# Mexico-AQI-Analysis
This project aims to predict and analyze air quality levels across various locations in Mexico using environmental data such as NOx, O3, CO, and other key pollutants. The model leverages the power of machine learning to forecast AQI values and detect anomalies in air quality, helping to identify regions with the best and worst air quality.
